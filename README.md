# VacationFormFiller
Used to autofill my vacation forms

Create a folder called "resources" , and one called "OutputtedFiles"
In Resources have the blank form to be filled called: "BlankForm.pdf" and an image file called "Signature.png"

Change the information and coordinates of lines 35-47 to match the form being filled out.
